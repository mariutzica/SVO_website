<p>Hello and welcome to the new home of the Scientific Variables Ontology!<p>

<p>This site is currently under construction. Please check back soon!</p>

<p>You can <a href="new_site/index.html">preview our new website</a> </p>

<p> ... or <a href='index_old.html'>browse our old website content</a>. Because the content of the old website has been archived, some links may be broken. The SPARQL endpoint and variable matching APIs have been disabled; however, all of the code required to run these services locally has been provided on GitHub.</p>
